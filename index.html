        <h1>Campus</h1>
        <p>Our campus is designed as an environment suitable for learning. Students arrive at the school and enter into their homeroom, where attendance will be taken. Once homeroom is over, students will head to their morning classes. In the middle of the day, lunch is eaten at the cafeteria. After lunch, students will proceed to their afternoon classes, then will be dismissed as necessary. After school, students may join clubs, which are meetings that take place dedicated to a single subject/topic. The classes taken by students are Math, Science, English Language Arts, Social Studies, Physical Education, Language (French, Italian, Spanish, or Mandarin), and an elective of their choice (Band, Choir, Orchestra, Art, etc.).</p>
